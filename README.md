People Expert, Supporting Engineers:  HumanResults.com

Hi!  
My name is Swat D. Doshi and I recently started a company, Human Results.  
If I was forced to select a niche user base, I'd want to focus on Engineers.  
Why?  
Every Engineer I've had the opportunity to spend at least 45 minutes or more with, I feel a connection with despite our VAST differences.  
By serving as a Coach/Advisor/Advocate for Engineers who want to work with me to self-actualize their potential, I am able to build a vocation rooted in my values (diversity and equality) and share knowledge in the areas I like to study most - people, human psychology, and relationships.  
I hope to contribute to the Engineers who are keeping the internet safe and creating products and services to make our lives better.  
You can learn more about me on HumanResults.com

People Propeller & Connector Supporting Engineers:  HumanResults.com 
=======
Hi!  

My name is Swat D. Doshi and I recently started a company, Human Results.  
When I was asked to select a niche client group, I chose Engineers.

Why?  

Every Engineer I've had the opportunity to work closely with, I've felt a connection with despite our VAST differences.  The folks I've worked with are eager to learn, curious, and care about making a difference.  These are things I relate to and define who I am and what I want to do. 

By serving as a Coach, Connector, and Advocate for Engineers who want to self-actualize their potential, I am able to build a vocation rooted in my values and share knowledge in areas I voraciously study - people, human psychology, and relationships.

I hope to contribute to Engineers who keep the internet safe and create products/services that make our lives better.
